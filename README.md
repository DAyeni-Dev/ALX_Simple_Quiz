# 🧠 Simple Interactive Quiz – Beginner JavaScript Project

This is a **basic quiz application** created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It presents a single multiple-choice question, allowing users to select an answer and get immediate feedback on whether they were correct — perfect for learning and applying core frontend concepts.

## 📌 Purpose

This project was developed as part of a frontend learning assignment to demonstrate:

- DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript  
- Conditional logic for real-time input evaluation  
- Clean and intuitive user interface design  
- Event handling and dynamic feedback  

The app simulates a simple quiz interaction and provides validation through a single question — ideal for beginners practicing JavaScript fundamentals.
